Soso C++ Style
==============

## Indentation

Use tabs, 2-spaces wide.

If the code snippets in this file look odd, make sure you are viewing it with [proper tab settings](STYLE.md?ts=2).

## Variable naming

Variables don't use prefixes, and are written with initialCapitals (camelCase).

```c++
// Member variables are written camelCase.
// Initialize value of built-in types at declaration.
float				memberVariable = 1.0f;
std::string anotherMember;
```
