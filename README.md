# Effective Cpp Demos

Console programs demonstrating techniques from Scott Meyerâ€™s Effective Cpp series.

Will also expand a bit from there, but that is the rock on which these are built.

Sample currently demonstrates managing resources (e.g. pointers) with objects. Shows off std::shared_ptr, unique_ptr, and moving from a unique_ptr to a shared_ptr.

## Building
```bash
$ make all
```

## Running
```bash
$ ./SampleName.sample
```

Concurrency (std::async, std::thread)
